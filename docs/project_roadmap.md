# Seismograph Project Roadmap & Development Guidelines

This document supplements the cleanup plan and modular engine vision by outlining critical considerations and best practices to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable project.

---

## 1. Prioritization & Milestones

- Define clear milestones for modular engine development with target dates.  
- Prioritize refactoring engines based on impact and data importance (e.g., mempool, scoring).  
- Set criteria for “production readiness” including test coverage, stability, and data accuracy.

---

## 2. Testing & Validation Strategy

- Develop unit, integration, and data validation tests for each engine.  
- Implement sanity checks on data (timestamps, value ranges, missing data).  
- Automate test runs as part of CI/CD to catch issues early.

---

## 3. Versioning and Database Migration

- Manage DB schema changes with versioned migrations to avoid data loss.  
- Version control engine and orchestrator configurations for traceability.  
- Plan rollback procedures in case of critical failures.

---

## 4. Performance & Resource Management

- Monitor resource consumption (CPU, RAM, DB IO) during engine runs.  
- Design for scaling: containerization, distributed processing, and horizontal scaling.  
- Implement retry and fallback logic for API failures and network issues.

---

## 5. Documentation & Onboarding

- Maintain thorough documentation on engine interfaces, configuration, and usage.  
- Create onboarding guides for new contributors or users.  
- Document assumptions, limitations, and data sources for transparency.

---

## 6. Security and Privacy

- Securely manage API keys and credentials using environment variables or secret managers.  
- Assess and mitigate any data security and privacy risks, especially if a UI or user data is introduced.

---

## 7. Feedback Loop

- Establish channels to collect feedback on data quality, signal usefulness, and bugs.  
- Use feedback to iterate quickly on engine improvements and new metrics.

---

## 8. Monetization Roadmap

- Plan phased SaaS platform development with key features and timelines.  
- Identify value propositions for early adopters and marketing strategies.  
- Prepare infrastructure for billing, support, and customer management.

---

## Summary

Adhering to these guidelines alongside the cleanup and modularization efforts will help ensure Seismograph is not only functional today but also scalable, maintainable, and commercially viable in the future.
